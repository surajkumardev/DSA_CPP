// //Graph data Structure => 
// A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and connections (edges) between them.
// Used to represent relationships, networks, and connections.

// ðŸ”¹ Key Points:

// Components:
// Vertices (V): The nodes of the graph.
// Edges (E): The connections (links) between vertices.

// Types of Graphs:
// Directed Graph (Digraph): Edges have a direction (A â†’ B).
// Undirected Graph: Edges donâ€™t have direction (A â€” B).
// Weighted Graph: Edges have weights/costs.
// Unweighted Graph: All edges are equal.

// Representation Methods:
// Adjacency Matrix: 2D array, O(VÂ²) space.
// Adjacency List: Each node stores a list of neighbors, O(V+E) space.

// Special Graphs:
// Tree: A connected acyclic graph.
// DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph): Directed graph with no cycles.
// Complete Graph: Every vertex is connected to every other.
  
// Applications:
// Social networks (users as nodes, friendships as edges).
// Computer networks (routers as nodes, connections as edges).
// Maps & GPS (cities as nodes, roads as weighted edges).
// Pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra, BFS, DFS).

// Graph Traversal:
// DFS (Depth First Search).
// BFS (Breadth First Search).
