Computer Science Subjects
1. Operating System
An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and computer hardware. The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs conveniently and efficiently. Below links contains complete Operating System Study Material:

2. DBMS
Database is a collection of inter-related data which helps in efficient retrieval, insertion and deletion of data from database and organizes the data in the form of tables, Links, schemas, reports etc. Below Links contains complete DBMS study Material:

3. SQL
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a language used to interact with the database, i.e to create a database, to create a table in the database, to retrieve data or update a table in the database. Below Links contains complete SQL study Material:

4. Computer Networks
A computer network is a system that connects numerous independent computers in order to share information (data) and resources. The integration of computers and other different devices allows users to communicate more easily. Below Links contains complete Computer Networks study Material:

Puzzles
Puzzles are one of the ways to check your problem-solving skills. These are tricky questions that let you think logically.

Projects
Thoroughly revise all the work you have done till now in your projects. The grilling about projects can sometimes be very deep. Also, choose your words before you speak. Mention only those topics where you think you are fine to be grilled upon.

If you haven't made a project then take an idea from GfG Projects and start working on these.

System Design
System Design is the process of designing the architecture, components, and interfaces for a system so that it meets the end-user requirements. System Design for tech interviews is something that canâ€™t be ignored especially for experienced people Almost every IT giant whether it be Facebook, Amazon, Google, or any other ask various questions based on System Design concepts such as scalability, load-balancing, caching, etc. in the interview.

Please refer
