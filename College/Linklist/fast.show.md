## The fast and slow pointer approach (also called Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm) is widely used in Linked List problems.
ðŸ”¹ Common Uses of Fast and Slow Pointers in Linked List
Detect cycle in a linked list.
Find the middle of a linked list.
Find the starting node of a cycle.
Check if a linked list is palindrome (with extra steps).
Iâ€™ll show you codes for

(1) Cycle detection 
(2) Find middle node since theyâ€™re the most important.
